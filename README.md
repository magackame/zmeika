## Building from source

You will need GHC to build

Just run `cabal build`

You may run `cabal build -O2` for maximum performance

> Tested on Linux, may work on other platforms

## WIP

- Migrate to proper TUI
  - Fix input lag
  - Fix flicker
  - Make world size adaptive (dependent on terminal size)
- Make snake speed adaptive
- Speed up the snake on button hold
- Beautify stuff???
